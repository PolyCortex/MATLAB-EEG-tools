##  Library Description

There are concrete applications to signal features extraction and classification with many carrying clinical implications.  One such application, is the study of sleep.  Sleep can be described as featuring several stages which are defined by EEG signal behavior in the time and the frequency domain.  Interestingly, sleep stages have well defined physiological and cognitive attributes.  For instance, normal wakefulness is characterized by activation of the prefrontal cortex [1, 2], which allows attention dependant reactivation of neural representations such as memory recall of knowledge and experience, and voluntary motor control [3-6].  In contrast, dreaming during sleep involves a deactivation of the prefrontal cortex, the accompanying loss of voluntary control and self-reflective awareness and the preservation of perception [2, 7].  Dreaming consciousness is further differentiated from waking consciousness by a shift in neuromodulation from wakeful aminergic dominance to dream cholinergic dominance [2, 8, 9].
